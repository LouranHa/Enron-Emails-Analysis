        "Enron Corporation fell from grace in a spectacular display of corporate fraud and corruption that has become legendary. With a market value of over $70 billion at its peak, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. The company was formed in 1985 through a merger. A complex web of fraudulent accounting practises and financial misconduct lay beneath Enron's apparent success. One of the most infamous corporate bankruptcies in American history occurred when the truth about Enron's fraudulent activities became public in 2001. The Enron scandal had far-reaching effects, including a devastating effect on investor confidence, the introduction of new regulations, and a fundamental shift in how corporate governance is viewed in the public's mind. The purpose of this case study is to examine the Enron Mail dataset, which consists of emails sent and received by Enron executives, employees, and associates, in order to learn more about the company's internal communication dynamics and identify areas of potential investigation. This analysis employs Python programming and data analysis techniques in an effort to elucidate the Enron scandal, investigate SQLite databases, visualise data, and follow programming best practises."

        " Examining Enron's internal dynamics and patterns can be aided by studying the company's communication and organisational structure. To learn more about how Enron communicated, one can use a number of different types of analyses and visualisations. To analyse email traffic over time, I can keep track of how many messages are sent on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. By plotting this information as a time series line chart, we can see if there are any peaks or valleys in communication that might indicate significant events or trends. Moreover, one more area to investigate is finding the most prolific email senders and receivers. By combining information from the 'Message' and 'Recipientinfo' tables, I can identify the employees who are the organization's most active email senders and receivers. Horizontal bar charts effectively summarise the most influential people in Enron's communication network. In addition, it is essential to know how emails are distributed based on the different types of recipients. The 'rtype' column in the 'Recipientinfo' table can be examined to determine whether an email was sent to the \"to,\" \"cc,\" or \"bcc\" addresses. I can evaluate how open, collaborative, and transparent Enron's communication practises are by comparing the percentage of emails sent to different recipient types using a pie chart or stacked bar chart."

The results of such an analysis can be very helpful in determining the level of cooperation or any attempts to conceal wrongdoing.\n",
