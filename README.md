# Enron Emails Analysis

The Enron Corporation was a prominent energy, commodities, and services company that became mired in a massive scandal and ultimately filed for bankruptcy; this scandal is the focus of the Enron case study. The purpose of this case study is to examine the Enron Mail dataset, which consists of emails sent and received by Enron executives, employees, and associates. The research utilises Python programming in Google Colab notebooks to delve into SQLite databases, data exploration, data visualisation, and programming best practises. By combining code, visualisations, and explanatory text in a single Python notebook, the analytical process can be made more transparent and easily understood by a wider audience.

## Aim
### The Purpose of analying Enron Case Study:
The goal of this project is to examine the Enron Mail dataset, which contains emails sent and received by Enron executives, employees, and associates, in order to learn more about the company's internal communication and find new areas of investigation.

Specifically, you will be using Python in Google Colab notebooks to investigate SQLite databases, visualise data, and implement programming best practises. The goal of this assignment is to provide a thorough understanding of the Enron Mail dataset and to highlight key trends and themes within the data by analysing email traffic over time, determining top senders and recipients, analysing email distribution by recipient type, conducting subject keyword analysis, and comparing internal and external communication. The assignment stresses the use of Python notebooks as a potent tool for producing data-driven business reports, as they permit the integration of code, visualisations, and narrative text to effectively communicate insights and findings. Additionally, the repository acts as a central location to store and share code, data, and documentation associated with the Enron email analyses, fostering collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency throughout the process.
